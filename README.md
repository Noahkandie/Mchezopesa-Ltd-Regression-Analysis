# Defining the Question

To create a model that will predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly while checking the rankings of the team.
Defining the Metric for Success

The project will be considered a success if the models created are able to predict results of a game to an assurity of above 80%
Understanding the context

The men's FIFA World Ranking is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football. The teams of the men's member nations of FIFA, football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992.

# How the rankings are calculated:

The rankings are calculated using an algorithm called Elo. The Elo method of calculation adds/subtracts points (as opposed to averaging points) for individual matches to/from a teamâ€™s existing point total. The points which are added or subtracted are partially determined by the relative strength of the two opponents, including the logical expectation that teams higher in the ranking should fare better against teams lower in the ranking.
Experimental design taken

In this study, we will be conducting Explorative Data Analysis, i.e Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis to get the relationships and differences between different variables. We will also create models using polynomial regression and logistic regression
Data Relevance

# We will be using data two datasets

FIFA rankings from 1993 to 2018 as fifa_rankings.csv This one shows the FIFA ranking and points for the teams. It shows a monthly ranking of team performance

International Soccer matches from 1872 to 2019 as results.csv This one shows teams, scores, tournament type and country the game was played from

Both our datasets consists of information on football rankings over time and are therefore suitable to create a model that will be used to predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly while checking the rankings of the team.
